# Intro-to-Computing-Project-1

This is my first project that I completed in my Intro to Computing course in Fall 2022. 
The purpose is to validate and compare different sets of tunes made from official music notation.
In this project, I learned how to build and use different types of functions and create an operable menu to access all of the capabilities of my code.
